# `NOTES` 

- always try to relate the problem to the one you have solved already i.e.
    - problem could be related to `sliding window` `MCM` `knapsack` `heap` `stack[NSL, NSR ...]` ...etc
- first always think of math approach to a problem 
- `a * b * c = GCD(a * b * c) * LCM(a * b * c)`
- if `GCD(a, b) == 1` -> a and b are co-prime
- for any general series write it in terms of prev element `An = An-1 + (somthign)` 
- two or more sets with nothing in common are called disjoint sets
- Longest Increasing Subsequence
